            <h2>PRICING</h2>
            <p>
                &quot;List Price &quot;means the suggested retail price of a
                product as provided by a manufacturer, supplier, or seller. We
                regularly check List Prices against prices recently found on
                Lagruni and other retailers. Certain products may have a
                &quot;Was Price &quot;displayed, which is determined using
                recent price history of the product on Lagruni.
            </p>
            <p>
                With respect to items sold by Lagruni, we cannot confirm the
                price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a
                small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If
                the correct price of an item sold by Lagruni is higher than our
                stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for
                instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you
                of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different
                policies in the event of a mispriced item.
            </p>
            <p>
                We generally do not charge your credit card until after your
                order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products,
                until we make the digital product available to you.
